#~ Results:
#~ It seems like Cheapest Link returns the fastest path in the graph, but 
#~ also runs longer than repeated nearest neighbor. Nearest Neighbor doesn't 
#~ seem to be the most optimal purely because one would be randomly choosing 
#~ a node to start on, which will not always be the most efficient. Repeated
 #~ Nearest Neighbor runs through every node as a starting node, thus it will 
 #~ yield better results with more time to run it. And then comes exhaustive 
 #~ search, which takes way too long, but it would give back the fastest way 
 #~ to traverse the graph, however it is way too long to wait because it is 
 #~ factorial time. Excluding Exhaustive Search, Cheapest Link took the longest 
 #~ to run, then Repeated Nearest Neighbor, and then Nearest Neighbor. But 
 #~ it can be seen that the more time an algorithm takes to run, the better 
 #~ the results will be. Cheapest Link came out with a cost of 2189, which 
 #~ is very very close to the actual value of 2085.
